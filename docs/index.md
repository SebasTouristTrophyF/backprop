### Abstract

This is a short tutorial on [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) and its implementation in Python, [C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/tour2.html), and [Cuda](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/even-easier-introduction-cuda/). The full codes for this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/maziarraissi/backprop).

#### Feed Forward

Let us consider the following densely connected deep neural network

taking as input $$X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p_0}$$ and outputting $$F \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p_{\ell+1}}$$. Here, $$n$$ denotes the number of data while the weights $$W_i \in \mathbb{R}^{p_i \times p_{i+1}}$$ and biases $$b_i \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times p_{i+1}}$$ represent the parameters of the neural network. Moreover, let us focus on the sum of squared errors loss function

$$
\mathcal{L} := \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{p_{\ell+1}} (F_{i,j} - Y_{i,j})^2,
$$

where $$Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p_{\ell+1}}$$ corresponds to the output data.

#### Back Propagation

The gradient of $$\mathcal{L}$$ with respect to $$F$$ is then given by

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
G_\ell = F - Y, & G_\ell \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p_{\ell+1}}.
\end{array}
$$

Using chain rule, the gradient of $$\mathcal{L}$$ with respect to $$W_\ell$$ is given by

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_\ell} = A_\ell^T G_\ell \in \mathbb{R}^{p_\ell \times p_{\ell+1}},
$$

and the gradient of $$\mathcal{L}$$ with respect to $$b_\ell$$ is given by

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b_\ell} = \mathbb{1}^T G_\ell \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times p_{\ell+1}},
$$

where $$\mathbb{1} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$$ is a matrix filled with ones. The gradient of $$\mathcal{L}$$ with respect to $$A_\ell$$ is given by

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A_\ell} = G_\ell W_\ell^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p_{\ell}}.
$$

Consequently, the gradient of $$\mathcal{L}$$ with respect to $$H_\ell$$, denoted by $$G_{\ell-1}$$, is given by

$$
G_{\ell-1} = (1 - A_\ell \odot A_\ell) \odot (G_\ell W_\ell^T) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p_{\ell}}.
$$

Here, we are using the fact that the derivative of $$\tanh(x)$$ with respect to $$x$$ is given by $$1-\tanh^2(x)$$. Moreover, $$\odot$$ denoted the point-wise product between two matrices. The above procedure can be repeated to give us the backpropagation algorithm

Moreover, the gradient of $$\mathcal{L}$$ with respect to $$X$$ is given by

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial X} = G_0 W_0^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p_{0}}.
$$
